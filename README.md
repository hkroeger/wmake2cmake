USAGE
====

This script creates a CMakeLists.txt from an existing wmake project.
It can then be used to load, edit and compile the application e.g. in QtCreator.

It has yet only been used for a few solvers from OpenFOAM's application 
directory and does not support all finesse of wmake by far. 

Contributions are welcome.
